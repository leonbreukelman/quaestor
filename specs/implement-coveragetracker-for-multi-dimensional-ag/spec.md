## Overview

CoverageTracker is a comprehensive testing utility designed to track and analyze multi-dimensional test coverage across agent testing scenarios. It provides granular insights into test coverage across tool, state, transition, and invariant dimensions, enabling developers to identify testing gaps and improve test quality.

## Problem Statement

Current testing approaches lack systematic methods for tracking comprehensive test coverage across multiple testing dimensions, leading to potential blind spots and incomplete test validation.

## User Stories

### US1 - Initialize Coverage Tracking Session (Priority: P0)

As a **Test Engineer**, I want to **start a new coverage tracking session for a test suite**, so that **systematically capture and analyze test coverage metrics**.

**Independent Test**: verify_coverage_session_initialization()

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Must support initializing tracking for multiple testing dimensions
2. Must generate a unique session identifier
3. Must reset all coverage counters to zero

### US2 - Record Test Coverage Dimensions (Priority: P0)

As a **Developer**, I want to **record coverage across tool, state, transition, and invariant dimensions**, so that **obtain comprehensive insight into test effectiveness**.

**Independent Test**: validate_multi_dimensional_coverage_tracking()

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Must track coverage percentages for each dimension
2. Must support granular tracking at individual element level
3. Must calculate coverage gaps automatically

### US3 - Merge Coverage Reports (Priority: P1)

As a **Test Manager**, I want to **consolidate coverage metrics from multiple test runs**, so that **aggregate coverage insights across different test executions**.

**Independent Test**: test_coverage_report_merging()

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Must support merging reports without data loss
2. Must handle overlapping and unique coverage scenarios
3. Must provide cumulative coverage percentages

## Functional Requirements

FR-001: FR-001: Track multi-dimensional test coverage
FR-002: FR-002: Calculate coverage percentages
FR-003: FR-003: Identify coverage gaps
FR-004: FR-004: Support report merging

## Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-001: NFR-001: Performance overhead must be minimal
NFR-002: NFR-002: Support large-scale test suites

## Open Questions

- [ ] What is the maximum supported test suite size?
- [ ] How will legacy test suites be migrated?

## Success Criteria

- Achieve >90% multi-dimensional coverage tracking accuracy
- Minimal performance impact during test execution
- Provide actionable insights for test improvement
