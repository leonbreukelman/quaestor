Include: 1) FixtureScope enum (TEST, SUITE, SESSION), 2) FixtureDefinition model with name, scope, description, dependencies list, and async flag, 3) FixtureValue model representing a resolved fixture value with metadata. Follow existing pattern from quaestor/testing/models.py. Do NOT implement registry or resolution - just the data models.",
