  "feature_description": "Create FixtureResolver class for resolving fixture dependencies. Include: 1) resolve(name: str, registry: FixtureRegistry) -> list[str] method returning topologically sorted dependency chain, 2) Detect and raise CyclicDependencyError for circular dependencies, 3) Raise FixtureNotFoundError if dependency doesn't exist in registry, 4) validate_dependencies(registry: FixtureRegistry) -> list[str] method to check all fixtures have valid dependencies. Build on existing FixtureRegistry and FixtureDefinition from quaestor/testing/fixtures.py. Do NOT implement scope management or value caching.",
