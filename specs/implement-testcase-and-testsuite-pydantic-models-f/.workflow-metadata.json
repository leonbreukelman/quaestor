  "feature_description": "Implement TestCase and TestSuite Pydantic models for Phase 2 Test Generation. Requirements: 1) Use discriminated union pattern for Assertion types (equals, contains, regex, tool_called, state_reached, schema_valid) with type-specific validation. 2) Loose coupling to analysis models - optional target_tool/target_state references. 3) Support both JSON and YAML serialization for OSCAL compatibility. Models needed: Assertion, TestCase, TestSuite, TestResult. Follow patterns from analysis/models.py. Target 100% test coverage.",
