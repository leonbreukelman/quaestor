  "feature_description": "Create ScopedFixtureManager class for managing fixture lifecycle with scope-based caching. Include: 1) get_or_create(name: str, registry: FixtureRegistry, factory: Callable) method that returns cached value for scope or creates new, 2) teardown_scope(scope: FixtureScope) method to destroy fixtures at scope boundary, 3) Built-in fixtures: 'test_id' (unique test identifier), 'temp_dir' (temporary directory cleaned after test). Build on existing FixtureRegistry, FixtureResolver, and FixtureScope from quaestor/testing/fixtures.py. Support both sync and async factories via is_async flag.",
