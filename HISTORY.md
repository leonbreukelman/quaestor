- [x] Pre-commit hooks
- [x] Automated testing on PR
- [ ] Documentation site (MkDocs)

### Code Quality (Achieved ✅)
- [x] 90% test coverage (target was 80%)
- [x] Type hints throughout (mypy)
- [ ] Docstrings for public API

### Performance (Future)
- [ ] Async execution for parallel tests

## 🚧 Known Blockers & Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| DeepTeam availability | Red team phase delayed | Use manual adversarial patterns initially |
| DSPy version conflicts | Build failures | Pin compatible versions, test matrix |
| Tree-sitter Python bindings | Code analysis limited | Fallback to AST module |
| LLM rate limits | Slow test runs | Implement caching, batching |

## 📝 Design Decisions Log

### 2026-01-13: Smactorio Integration Strategy
**Decision:** Tight coupling with Smactorio as core dependency
**Rationale:**
- Smactorio provides governance-as-a-service needed for compliant agent testing
- Shared LLM infrastructure reduces complexity
- Agent patterns (BaseAgent, AgentFactory) directly applicable
- DSPy integration already battle-tested
- Enables deterministic, auditable testing workflows

### 2026-01-13: Python Version Constraint
**Decision:** Require Python >=3.12
**Rationale:**
- Smactorio requires 3.12+
- Modern typing features (TypedDict, Self, etc.)
- Performance improvements in 3.12

### 2026-01-13: DeepTeam Deferral
**Decision:** Place red team capabilities on roadmap, not initial release
**Rationale:**
- Package availability uncertain
- Core functionality (analysis, testing, evaluation) more critical
- Can implement basic adversarial testing manually first
